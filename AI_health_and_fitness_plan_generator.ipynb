            "2.  **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day, but try not to fill up on water right before meals.\n",

            "    *   Add an extra tablespoon of nut butter to oatmeal or snacks.\n",

            "    *   Consider calorie-dense smoothies with added nut butters, seeds, and even avocado.\n",
            "6.  **Meal Timing:** Spread your meals and snacks evenly throughout the day to maintain a consistent caloric intake and nutrient supply.\n",
            "7.  **Sleep:** Adequate sleep is crucial for recovery and hormone regulation, which plays a role in weight gain.\n",
